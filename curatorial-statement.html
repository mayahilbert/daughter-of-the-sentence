        <blockquote>&ldquo;On one hard evening, my father warned me &ldquo;The daughter of the sentence will bring the
            death of Socrates.&rdquo; <em>The Death of Socrates</em>, a painting by Jacques-Louis David, is one we regularly stop by
            together to view at The Met. His tone was dark, but the painting&rsquo;s name marks a remembrance of our
            last visit compressed into his present fear of disappearing.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<br>

        <p>The New Media Artspace proudly presents <em>Lynn Sullivan: Daughter of the Sentence</em>, a solo exhibition
            featuring a new four-part cycle of video works. In <em>Daughter of the Sentence</em>, Sullivan focuses on
            her relationship with her father, an analytic philosopher now suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease with
            Sullivan as his primary caretaker. Anchored by her father&rsquo;s specialization in the philosophy of
            language, the new works in this exhibition also extend Sullivan&rsquo;s own career-long exploration of the
            materiality of language. Modeled out of quotidian ephemera culled from her art studio and her father&rsquo;s
            office, Sullivan&rsquo;s videos oscillate between tender, intimate portraits and withholding, analytic
            structures. Her father, an ostensible subject of these works, stays largely absent off-screen, while
            once-ordered formations of language are animated by forces of undoing: wind blowing, hands shuffling,
            letters cut loose only to obscure. Inevitable mortality inflects Sullivan&rsquo;s elegy to intellectual
            rigor unraveling.</p>

        <p>Simultaneously, <em>Daughter of the Sentence </em>is haunted by the legacies of two key figures: the famed
            artist Robert Morris, who was Sullivan&rsquo;s mentor, and the prominent analytic philosopher Donald
            Davidson, whose pivotal work in the philosophy of language influenced both Morris and the elder Sullivan.
            The online exhibition incorporates Sullivan&rsquo;s rubbing drawings. Created through the physical touch of
            a textured surface, her <em>Gnaw Series</em> utilizes a similar tactility as Morris&rsquo;s influential
            <em>Blind Time Drawings</em>. Morris created these drawings using his inked fingers while blindfolded and
            paired each with a quotation from Davidson. Morris&rsquo;s most direct engagement with Davidson, this series
            occasioned a written exchange between the artist and the philosopher. While Morris elected to disable his
            sight, Sullivan&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s diminished faculties are the result of disease, not volition. Thus,
            in <em>Daughter of the Sentence, </em>Sullivan&rsquo;s meditation on mind and agency (themes her father
            studied in depth in the work of Davidson and others) also melds with its inverse: a deliberation on death
            and incapacity.</p>

        <p>The in-person exhibition is contextualized by prints from Sullivan’s <cite>Gnaw Series</cite>, in which site-specific rubbings are digitally enlarged to evoke mountain ranges. The <cite>Gnaw Series</cite> prints, which result from physical contact with the environment, appear beside magnified marginalia from philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe’s <cite>Intention</cite> that Sullivan’s father returned to over decades. Together, they show two poles from the artist’s context of reference. Her artistic practice is entwined in these two different ways of knowing about the world.</p>


<hr>

        <p>&ldquo;Seeing as is not seeing that.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> Donald Davidson makes
            this claim while explicating his controversial theory of metaphor. Davidson insists that metaphors have no
            special &ldquo;metaphoric meaning.&rdquo; That is, they mean nothing beyond the literal meaning of their
            words. What if we translate this Davidsonian move from the philosophy of language to new media art? What
            happens when, in Sullivan&rsquo;s video <em>Usage</em> for example, a twisted letter form appears in one
            area of the frame and, after a period of black, reappears in another sector? We would be wrong to imagine
            that it traveled continuously from point A to point B under cover of night. Rather, if we follow Davidson,
            every image needs to be taken for exactly what it is (namely a snapshot that records something that once
            occurred, thus operating mnemonically) and every black section of video should be taken as what <em>it</em>
            is (namely the disturbing experience of no image or no mnemonic recall). A black out of the screen would
            need to be understood as a literal black out (the black out of mnemonic recall where no recorded image
            exists) equal to the literal meaning of metaphor for Davidson. So, any space and time elapsing between
            images would need to be absorbed whole in the disarming duration of real time, as presence in absentia.</p>

        <p>In Sullivan&rsquo;s works, video black often provides a ground against which objects change position from one
            photographic image to the next. This technique is the foundation of stop motion animation wherein a series
            of still images, played back in sequence and at a sufficiently rapid frame rate, creates the illusion of
            movement. Nevertheless, our thought experiment with Davidson reveals that Sullivan&rsquo;s works are the
            opposite of animations. Animations ask us to politely ignore the gaps between their frames. In contrast, the
            yawning chasms Sullivan leaves intact between images are impossible to overlook. Only by suspending
            disbelief and willfully <em>not seeing</em> those cuts, can we believe an animated image moves continuously.
            But when we take those spans of blackness at face value, the actual absent subject of Sullivan&rsquo;s works
            is revealed. That subject is discontinuity itself: of memory (discontinuity between a mind and a minder), of
            movement (discontinuity between a body and a space), of language (discontinuity between a word and its
            referent), of agency (discontinuity between intention and action).</p>

        <p>Consider Sullivan&rsquo;s treatment in two works in the exhibition, <em>Usage </em>and <em>Minders</em>. In
            <em>Minders</em>, a black screen pulses with vestiges from a lifetime of reading. A row of well-worn
            paperbacks stands six abreast. (Sullivan has disclosed that these are her father&rsquo;s copies of favorite
            texts by Davidson, Anscombe, Quine, and Peirce.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>) Their curling
            yellowed pages and creased spines could stand for six heads of blonde hair, perhaps a reference to
            &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; born of the sentences they contain. Adorning their paper locks like barrettes or
            bows, makeshift bookmarks&mdash;a post-it note in one, paperclips in others&mdash;mark sections to revisit.
            The screen begins to pulse with cryptic configurations of paperclips and post-its: first a pile, then an
            array, then ordered horizontally, then vertically, then reordered, repositioned, spaced evenly, spaced
            oddly, always punctuated by rifts of unrelenting blackness. When the books appear again, they pulse on and
            off: like a beacon, like breathing, like a beating heart. A neat line of five paperclips flashes
            frenetically as if to convey a coded message, underscoring communicative urgency, but revealing nothing of
            significance.</p>

        <p>Sullivan&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;minders&rdquo; as the title of this work evokes <em>mind</em> as an
            embodied faculty that may come to require an external object to augment its capacities; <em>reminders</em>
            as placeholders that recall one&rsquo;s reading to a select passage; and the job of <em>minding</em>, as
            when one submits to minding one&rsquo;s business, minding one&rsquo;s manners, minding one&rsquo;s
            parent&rsquo;s rules, minding one&rsquo;s child or ward, even when that ward is a parent. <em>I am becoming
                my father&rsquo;s keeper, my father&rsquo;s minder. </em>The paperclips in <em>Minders</em> could
            stand-in for a father being minded. As minders that bind, they link him to his self-conception as someone
            whose existence is thoroughly wrapped up in language. Minders bridge these discontinuities, holding our
            mental, social, and linguistic selves together.</p>

        <p>Sullivan credits her upbringing under her father&rsquo;s influence with her ongoing artistic investment in
            what she calls &ldquo;the strangeness of words&rdquo; and her desire to &ldquo;make words physical.&rdquo;<a
                href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> In previous sculptural and installational works, she has
            positioned monumentally scaled words in landscapes and architectural contexts to show how language depends
            on&mdash;in these cases literally leaning against&mdash;its environment. However, in another video,
            <em>Usage</em>, the dark void of the screen shows the alphabetic material of language absent that support.
            Pulsing cuts to black flash on letters cut singly or in mutant combinations from white paper. Language is
            physicalized, rendered in material form, but with no context&mdash;environmental or social&mdash;to emplace
            an utterance or hold up a meaning. Devoid of such supports in <em>Usage</em>, words collapse. Curling up on
            themselves, they are utterly inscrutable.</p>

        <p>Frontally illuminated, these buckled letters recall globs of snow falling in a car&rsquo;s headlights.
            Ultimately, they begin to pile up like a snow drift, filling the bottom of the screen. As this
            word-substance accrues, Sullivan could be illustrating a late stage in Davidson&rsquo;s theory of
            triangulation verbatim. In Davidson&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;language fills in and enriches the base of the
            triangle&rdquo; that issues between two observers, each focused on an external object they both perceive
            while using language to &ldquo;correlate&rdquo; their responses to it.<a href="#_edn5"
                name="_ednref5">[5]</a> It is precisely this communal, shared world that is absent in <em>Usage</em>. In
            aphasia (which often accompanies Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease), brain damage erodes neurological links between
            words and meanings. It is as though the trajectories bonding observers to object (forming the sides of that
            triangle) are severed, leaving language to accumulate at its base without appropriate reference to the
            world. As substance out of place, <em>Usage</em>&rsquo;s twisted words refute &ldquo;usage&rdquo; as
            language qua language.</p>

        <p>With strobe-like pulses referencing Morse Code, a glitch in language conveys &ldquo;Morse&rdquo; to
            &ldquo;Morris.&rdquo; Robert Morris was Sullivan&rsquo;s mentor, a professor with whom she worked closely as
            a graduate student.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a> In his well-known <em>Blind Time Drawings,
            </em>Morris inscribed quotations from Davidson alongside the instruction set he followed to create each
            drawing. The two engaged in mutual commentary in <em>Critical Inquiry</em>&rsquo;s special issue on Davidson
            and his influence. In his contribution, Morris described a tendency to fail to see absence resulting from
            belief. &ldquo;We always believe before we look,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;We always assume (theorize) a
            wholeness of the visual. We believe to such an extent that we do not &lsquo;see&rsquo; the absences. Can
            seeing something obscure dark reason?&rdquo;<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a> These words could not
            be more uncannily apt for the Morse-like disjunctions of Sullivan&rsquo;s non-animations.</p>

        <p>Morris sought &ldquo;dark reason&rdquo; in a literal manner by blindfolding himself to operate in darkness.
            The terse instructions he set out for himself to create <em>Blind Time Drawings </em>are every bit as opaque
            as the curt cuts in <em>Minders </em>or <em>Usage.</em> None of these works willingly reveal their dark
            reasons. Without sight, Morris resorted to touch, a tactile drawing method in which indexicality closes the
            temporal delay that preoccupied Donaldson. Sullivan&rsquo;s own indexical drawings from her <em>Gnaw Series
            </em>use rubbing or <em>frottage </em>so that the physical world informs its own image as texture. Unlike
            Morris&rsquo; <em>Blind Time Drawings</em>, which are accompanied by texts, Sullivan&rsquo;s rubbings are
            non-verbal counterparts to her enigmatic works with words: indexicality obviates exposition.
            Sullivan&rsquo;s <em>Gnaw Series</em> appears to extend Morris&rsquo; interests, as if to rub away a burden
            of signification. Simultaneously, her mark-making seems in sympathy with her father&rsquo;s &ldquo;fear of
            disappearing,&rdquo; striving to leave a trace of her existence as a body in space. As Sullivan
            &ldquo;mashes&rdquo; herself against what she sees, like language propped against environment, rubbing makes
            her mark on (and of) the world.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>

        <p>That tactility translates into <em>Cling </em>and <em>Daughter of the Sentence. </em>In <em>Cling</em>, paper
            letters swarm a stack of three stained coffee mugs. (Sullivan considers the coffee cup &ldquo;a key
            object&rdquo; for her father, &ldquo;a chronic drinker of coffee.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn9"
                name="_ednref9">[9]</a>) These quotidian objects bear his touch; his traces streak their surfaces.
            However, Sullivan&rsquo;s father is not the instigator of action in this work, and his mugs get gradually
            buried behind a cloud of letters that fills the screen. The letters flutter illegibly, moved by the
            video&rsquo;s true protagonist: gusts of air. A breeze may blow to clear away cobwebs, but this unseen wind
            works as a magical force to draw clutter in. As letterforms cling to one another and the cups, the threesome
            are defamiliarized, then swallowed.</p>

        <p>In the exhibition&rsquo;s titular work, <em>Daughter of the Sentence</em>, we see Sullivan&rsquo;s father for
            the first time. His hesitant hands maneuver grey letters on a wooden table, searchingly stirring spellings.
            Unlike in previous videos, the letters lie flat, inviting comprehension. They appear on the verge of
            spelling something, but never cohere as sense. His calmness indicates that sense-making isn&rsquo;t a
            concern. Instead, tactile experience guides his gestures as he explores the letter&rsquo;s textures gliding
            on the tabletop. This action alternates with scenes of obscure clusters of letterforms, tenuously adhered to
            white orbs. The tumbling word-balls waft loftily in and out of frame, alphabetic appendages fluttering.
            Tossed in the air or rolling along the ground, soft winds enliven them.</p>

        <p>If Sullivan&rsquo;s non-animations alternate stasis and nothingness, <em>Daughter of the Sentence </em>and
            <em>Cling </em>are in constant oscillation, moved by gusts of air. Air caresses objects, blows words.
            Sullivan has identified ground and air as two prime sites of language&rsquo;s vulnerability.<a
                href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a> Surely, these two materials&mdash;air and ground&mdash;are also
            common imagery for the end of life. A ghostly soul floats heavenward through air. A body is laid to rest
            underground. When air pours out of our mouths like wind, we speak. When air escapes out of our lungs like
            wind, we suffocate. This exhale pertains even where it doesn&rsquo;t explain. Morris was described as having
            &ldquo;deflationary objectives&rdquo; in his exchange with Davidson,<a href="#_edn11"
                name="_ednref11">[11]</a> and Davidson in turn asked himself whether there might not be &ldquo;something
            sinister .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in [his own] views that [he had] failed to recognize, something that portends
            .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dissolution.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> <em>A sigh escapes us.</em>
        </p>

        <p>Having opening his essay about Morris with this dark question, Davidson pondered how &ldquo;alienation&rdquo;
            bars an artist or writer from their externalized creation. He quoted Plato on &ldquo;the gulf between
            talking to a person and reading his words.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> Just as an
            artwork, when questioned, &ldquo;maintain[s] a most majestic silence,&rdquo; so too, &ldquo;written words
            .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go on telling you just the same thing for ever.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn14"
                name="_ednref14">[14]</a> For Davidson, elapsing time isolates artworks and frustrates immediacy in all
            communication. Sullivan shows us how this incapacity at the heart of communication extends beyond the remit
            of language to the human condition. Time spoils synchronicity between any two people, bringing as it does
            the advent of age, disease, and that ultimate discontinuity, death. <em>Daughter of the Sentence </em>opens
            withering channels of communication that stretch between daughter and father, across isolation. These
            artworks triangulate a relationship that grounds them, animating closeness, even in absentia.</p>
